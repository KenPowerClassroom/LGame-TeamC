### What is the purpose of this document
The purpose of this document is to describe and report the analysis we made about the L Game, its rules and strategies. This document will help the implementation of this game. 

### Why are we doing this project
The project is to develop an c++ application of the L Game. This exercise is part of the software engineering class of the Computer Games Development course taught by [Ken Power](https://github.com/kenpower) at IT Carlow, Ireland. 

## Game description
The L Game Was created by Edward De Bono in a book he released in 1967 called “The Five-Day Course in Thinking”. It also been said that the L Game's humble beginnings started during a dinner conversation between Edward de Bono and mathematician Professor Littlewood. Both agreed that, chess was difficult due to how hard the game is, the billions of possibilities there are to win the game and how you had to keep track of every piece you had and every piece your opponent had. Which is insanely difficult for people to play and understand chess. De Bono loves to play games, but dislikes to play games where there is a lot of pieces you have to keep track of. So the result was the L Game. There are 2,296 distinct board positions or 18,268 if rotations and reflections are counted.

The game itself is a two player game. The game is played on a board that is has a 4x4 square grid. Each player has their own L shape that has a size of 3x2 square grid. There is also 2 neutral pieces that have a size of 1x1 on the square grid. The game itself is really simple to play, but very hard to master. The reason for this is because there are multiple strategies to play the game.  And some of these strategies work only certain scenarios in the L Game and this is why this game is considered to be a very strategic game. You have to think ahead and plan out what you want to do to defeat your opponent.
